== Create Terms

The only way to create a new term is to make a migration. Since a term should always have at least one version, the migration will also create a version.

Hopefully, there is trait that might help you to do so. Here is an example of the usage of this trait:

[source, php]
----
use Doctrine\DBAL\Schema\Schema;
use Doctrine\Migrations\AbstractMigration;
use RichId\TermsModuleBundle\Infrastructure\Migrations\TermsMigrationTrait;

final class RandomMigration extends AbstractMigration
{
    use TermsMigrationTrait;

    public function up(Schema $schema): void
    {
        $this->createTerms('my_slug', 'My Terms');
    }

    public function down(Schema $schema): void
    {
        $this->deleteTerms('my_slug');
    }
}
